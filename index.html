                <p class="intro-text">
                    I am an Art Psychotherapist registered with the HCPC. I am also a member of the British Association
                    of Art Therapists.
                    As an Art Psychotherapist, my training emphasises art-making as an integral non-verbal part of the
                    therapeutic process. Art is used as a medium to address and work through emotional difficulties,
                    which may be confusing or distressing, and at times too difficult to put into words.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Art therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its primary mode of expression and
                    communication. My approach makes space for
                    unconscious communications which can be contained within artmaking alongside the
                    therapeutic relationship.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    This often includes working sensitively with emerging themes in sessions,
                    although I am able to take a more directive or side-by-side-approach
                    depending on the presenting needs. I offer sessions from Caya Therapy's purpose built
                    art room, which I believe holds the potential for more in depth creative
                    exploration within sessions. There is no expectation of artistic skills or experience.

                        I work with a high degree of sensitivity and ability to establish warm positive relationships,
                        which
                        includes a comprehensive understanding of informed consent and relational security. I hope this
                        also
                        reflects my approach to therapy as a collaborative and relational process.

                <p class="intro-text">
                    My previous training and work has included working with adults in acute and
                    community settings. I also have ongoing experience in working therapeutically
                    with children and young people with complex difficulties including attachment
                    difficulties, bereavement, behaviour challenges, ADHD and Autism.
                    This has included supporting people with varied access requirements and
                    complex needs associated with disability, and illness. I therefore also work with
                    the recognition that social, political and cultural conditions shape lives and
                    can have a disproportionate impact on emotional wellbeing.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">

                    Alongside my private practice I work part-time as part of a Creative Therapies team delivering 1-2-1
                    sessions for young people in schools. I am particularly passionate about promoting a culture
                    of early invention and holding space for emotional literacy and psychoeducation.
                    I believe this is equally important when working with adults.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">

                    My practice is underpinned
                    by the principles of psychodynamic psychotherapy, integrating a dynamic,
                    person-centred and trauma-informed approach. I work with a high degree of relational sensitivity and
                    believe the
                    experience of feeling heard and understood can be an important first step in
                    making sense of our experiences.
