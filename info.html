                    Sessions last for 50 minutes and occur weekly at an agreed time.

                <p class="intro-text">

                    The fee per session is £75 and can be paid by cash or bank transfer in advance or on the day of the
                    appointment. If sessions are cancelled with less than 2 working days notice or you do not attend,
                    you
                    will have to pay the full fee. I do not charge for sessions you cannot attend provided you give me a
                    minimum of 2 working days
                    notice.

                    My private practice is located in the art room at Caya Therapy in Peckham. Please note if
                    you arrive
                    late you will still need to pay for the whole session and we will also have to finish on time.

                <p class="intro-text" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 5px;">



                    You can decide to end therapy at any time, however I recommend a few weeks notice period
                    work through the ending as this can often be an important part of the therapeutic process. This can
                    be
                    talked through as part of beginning therapy.

                <p class="intro-text" style="margin-top: 5px;">
                    Brief notes on the sessions, art work, art work documentation will be stored securely by the
                    therapist, and will not be identified by name. Some general information about the progress of the
                    therapy will be discussed with the therapist’s clinical supervisor, as required by HCPC guidelines.
                    Any artworks made during sessions will be safely stored onsite in a lockable cupboard and made
                    accessible each session for the duration of therapy. At the end of therapy you may chose to keep
                    some of the artworks made in session, which will be thought about as part of the ending process. If
                    you do
                    not wish to keep the artwork yourself I will have to dispose of these as part of keeping to current
                    recommended standards of practice and confidentiality.
